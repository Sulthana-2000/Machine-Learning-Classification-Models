Classification models are a type of machine learning model used to predict categorical outcomes or class labels based on input features.
They are widely used across various fields, including finance, healthcare, marketing, and more. Here are some common classification models:

# 1.Logistic Regression:
Despite its name, logistic regression is a linear model used for binary classification tasks.
It predicts the probability of an observation belonging to a particular class using a logistic function.

# 2.Decision Trees:
Decision trees partition the feature space into regions and make predictions based on the majority class in each region.
They are easy to interpret and visualize but can be prone to overfitting.

# 3.Random Forest:
Random forest is an ensemble learning method that consists of multiple decision trees.
It improves upon the performance of decision trees by reducing overfitting and increasing accuracy.

# 4.Support Vector Machines (SVM):
SVM is a powerful classification algorithm that finds the hyperplane that best separates classes in the feature space.
It is effective in high-dimensional spaces and can handle non-linear decision boundaries through the use of kernel functions.

# 5.Naive Bayes:
Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with an assumption of independence between features.
Despite its simplicity, it often performs well on text classification and other tasks with high-dimensional data.

# 6.K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
KNN makes predictions by finding the majority class among the K nearest neighbors of a data point in the feature space.
It is simple and intuitive but can be computationally expensive, especially with large datasets.

These are just few examples of classification models commonly used in machine learning. This repository contains collection of classification models using various datasets.
Each model is designed to predict categorical outcomes or class labels based on input features.
